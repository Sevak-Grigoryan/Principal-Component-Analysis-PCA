# Principal Component Analysis (PCA) Implementation

This repository contains a custom implementation of the Principal Component Analysis (PCA) algorithm in Python. It showcases how PCA can be applied to reduce the dimensionality of data, with detailed steps provided for 2D and 3D data.

## Repository Structure

- **PCA.py**: Contains the core implementation of the PCA algorithm from scratch.
- **main.py**: Demonstrates how to use the PCA implementation in real-world scenarios by calling functions from `PCA.py`.
- **2D - 1D.ipynb**: A Jupyter Notebook that walks through the process of reducing 2D data to 1D using PCA, with visualizations and step-by-step explanations.
- **3D - 2D.ipynb**: A Jupyter Notebook that explains the reduction of 3D data to 2D using PCA, including plots and detailed breakdowns of the algorithm.

## Features

- **Custom Implementation**: The PCA algorithm is implemented from scratch without relying on libraries like scikit-learn.
- **Versatility**: Works for data in both 2D and 3D formats.
- **Educational**: Includes notebooks that explain the algorithm step by step with code and visualizations.

## How to Use

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone <[repository-url](https://github.com/Sevak-Grigoryan/Principal-Component-Analysis-PCA.git)>
   cd <Principal-Component-Analysis-PCA>
   ```

2. Run the `main.py` file to see an example usage of the PCA implementation:
   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

3. Explore the Jupyter Notebooks for detailed walkthroughs:
   - Open `2D - 1D.ipynb` to see PCA applied to 2D data.
   - Open `3D - 2D.ipynb` to explore PCA for 3D data.

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.7+
- Required Python libraries:
  - NumPy
  - Pandas
  - Matplotlib
  - Jupyter Notebook

Install dependencies using pip:
```bash
pip install numpy pandas matplotlib notebook
```

## Visualizations
The notebooks include detailed visualizations that:
- Show the data before and after applying PCA.
- Illustrate how the principal components are calculated and used for transformation.
